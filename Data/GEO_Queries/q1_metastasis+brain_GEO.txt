2. The immune suppressive tumor microenvironment affects efficacy of radio-immunotherapy in breast-to-brain metastasis
(Submitter supplied) The tumor microenvironment in brain metastases is characterized by high myeloid cell content with immune-suppressive and cancer-permissive functions. Moreover, brain metastases induce the recruitment of lymphocytes. Despite their presence, T cell-directed therapies fail to elicit effective anti-tumor immune responses. Here we seek to evaluate the applicability of radio-immunotherapy to modulate tumor immunity and overcome inhibitory effects that diminish anti-cancer activity. more...

(Submitter supplied) Fixed-Tissue ChIP-seq for H3K27Ac profiling (FiTAc-seq) is an epigenetic method for profiling active enhancers and promoters in FFPE tissues. We previously developed a modified ChIP-seq protocol (FiT-seq) for chromatin profiling in FFPE. FiT-seq produces high-quality chromatin profiles particularly for methylated histone marks but is not optimized for H3K27Ac profiling. FiTAc-seq is a modified protocol that replaces the proteinase K digestion applied in FiT-seq with extended heating at 65°C in more stringent detergent conditions and a minimized sonication step, to produce robust genome-wide H3K27Ac maps from clinical samples. more...

Using serial single cell RNA-sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find upregulation of Prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lung expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand Prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2). more...

Tumor blood vessel components (endothelial cells and mural cells) are also ubiquitous within tumors, and yet, the impact of these tumor-resident cells is scarcely understood beyond oxygen and nutrients supply. Our hypothesis is that the interaction between stromal cells and tumor cells is bidirectional: tumor cells can modulate their peripheral environment that in turn becomes more favorable to tumor growth. more...

115. Exploring the spatiotemporal genetic heterogeneity in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma using a nuclei flow-sorting approach
(Submitter supplied) Variable tumor cellularity can limit sensitivity and precision in comparative genomics, because differences in tumor content can result in misclassifying truncal mutations as region-specific private mutations in stroma-rich regions, especially when studying tissue specimens of mediocre tumor cellularity such as LUADs. To address this issue, we refined a nuclei flow-sorting approach by sorting nuclei based on ploidy and the LUAD lineage marker thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and applied this method to investigate genome-wide somatic copy number aberrations (SCNA) and mutations of 409 cancer genes in 39 tumor populations obtained from 16 primary tumors and 21 matched metastases. more...

(Submitter supplied) Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To generate more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets, enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. more...

117. Intercellular transfer of small RNAs from astrocytes to lung tumor cells induces resistance to chemotherapy.
(Submitter supplied) Brain metastases are highly resistance to chemotherapy and have a poor prognosis for cure. Tumor cells are surrounded by activated astrocytes and exploit their cyto-protective properties for protection from apoptosis induced by chemotherapy. The mechanism by which astrocytes protect tumor cells is poorly understood. An important non-mutational mechanism of chemotherapy resistance is regulation of gene translation mediated by small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), in particular, microRNAs (miRNAs). more...

119. Leukemia hijacks a neural mechanism to invade the central nervous system
(Submitter supplied) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has a striking propensity to metastasize to the central nervous system (CNS).1 In contrast to solid tumor brain metastases, ALL seldom involves the parenchyma but is isolated to the leptomeninges, an infrequent site for carcinomatous invasion.2,3 While CNS metastasis is characteristic across ALL subtypes, a unifying mechanism for invasion has not been determined. Here we show that ALL cells in circulation are unable to breach the blood brain barrier; instead they migrate into the CNS along vessels that passage directly between vertebral or calvarial bone marrow (BM) and the subarachnoid space. more...

While CIN is a major driver of tumor evolution, its role in metastasis has not been established. Here we show that CIN promotes metastasis by sustaining a tumor-cell autonomous inflammatory response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose envelopes frequently rupture exposing their DNA content to the cytosol. more...

This transition facilitates tumor cells to acquire motility and invasive features. Intriguingly, tumor cells at the metastatic site are primarily epithelial, and it is believed that they re-differentiate back to an epithelial state by a process called mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). more...

The mechanisms that underlie subgroup specification are largely unknown. While human SHH MBs express MYCN, Group3 (G3) MBs are associated with c-MYC (MYC) overexpression and often show metastasis that confers a poor prognosis. Although MYC proteins are thought to be functionally exchangeable, ectopic expression of Myc or N-myc in Trp53-/-;Cdkn2c-/- cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) induces G3 and SHH MBs, respectively, demonstrating that each Myc protein has distinct biological properties. more...

180. Treatment effects of trastuzumab and TDM-1 in a murine model of breast cancer brain metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Background: Central nervous system (CNS) metastases represent a major problem in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer due to the disappointing efficacy of HER2-targeted therapies in the brain microenvironment. The antibody-drug conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has shown efficacy in trastuzumab-resistant systemic breast cancer. Here, we tested the hypothesis that T-DM1 could overcome trastuzumab resistance in preclinical models of brain metastases. more...

189. Single-cell analysis reveals a stem cell program in human metastatic breast cancer cells (PDX mice - cancer cells)
(Submitter supplied) Despite major advances in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cancer, metastasis remains the cause of >90% of cancer-related mortality1. Understanding metastasis initiation and progression is critical to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent metastatic disease. Prevailing theories hypothesize that metastases are seeded by rare tumor cells with unique properties, which may function like stem cells in their ability to initiate and propagate metastatic tumors.2 3-5 However, the identity of metastasis-initiating cells in human breast cancer remains elusive, and whether metastases are hierarchically organized is unknown.2 Here we show at the single-cell level that early stage metastatic cells possess a distinct stem-like gene expression signature. more...

214. Determination of prognosis in metastatic melanoma through integration of clinico-pathologic, mutation, mRNA, microRNA, and protein information
(Submitter supplied) In patients with metastatic melanoma, the identification and validation of accurate prognostic biomarkers will assist rational treatment planning. Studies based on "-omics" technologies have focussed on a single high-throughput data type such as gene or microRNA transcripts. Occasionally, these features were evaluated in conjunction with limited clinico-pathologic data. With the increased availability of multiple data types, there is a pressing need to tease apart which of these sources contain the most valuable prognostic information. more...

215. Analysis of tumor- and stroma-supplied proteolytic networks in different metastatic tumor microenvironments identifies a critical role for cathepsin S in brain metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Metastasis is a multistage process that requires cancer cells to escape from the primary tumor, survive in the circulation, seed at distant sites and colonize these foreign tissue environments. Each of these processes involves rate-limiting steps that are influenced by stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment. While the tumor microenvironment has emerged as a major regulator of cancer progression in other organ sites, our knowledge of the brain metastatic microenvironment is currently very limited. more...

(Submitter supplied) The major cause of cancer-related deaths in lung cancer patients is commonly attributed to its ability to metastasize to distant organs such as the bone, brain, liver and adrenal glands. The dysregulation in miRNA expression is believed to contribute toward the initiation and progression of metastasis through their capability to regulate target genes. In this study, two NSCLC sub-cell lines possessing opposing migration and invasion properties were established using serial transwell invasion assays, followed by miRNA microarray to obtain the overview of miRNA expression as well as identify important playes in metastasis.

251. Micro-scale genomic copy number aberrations as another means of mutagenesis in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: In breast cancers, the basal-like subtype has high levels of genomic instability relative to other breast cancer subtypes with many basal-like-specific regions of aberration. There is evidence that this genomic instability extends to smaller scale genomic aberrations as well, as shown by a previously described micro-event in the PTEN gene in the Basal-like SUM149 breast cancer cell line. more...

252. Cancer-produced metabolites of 5-lipoxygenase induce tumor-evoked Bregs via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer cells facilitate distant metastasis through the induction of immunosuppressive regulatory B cells, designated tBregs. We report here that, to do this, breast cancer cells produce metabolites of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to activate the proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in B cells. Inactivation of LTB4 signaling or genetic deficiency of PPARalpha in B cells blocks the generation of tBregs and thereby abrogates lung metastasis in mice with established breast cancer. more...

258. Epigenetic expansion of VHL-HIF signal output drives multiorgan metastasis in renal cancer
(Submitter supplied) Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene, VHL, is an archetypical tumor-initiating event in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) that leads to the activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). However, VHL mutation status in ccRCC is not correlated with clinical outcome. Here we show that during ccRCC progression, cancer cells exploit diverse epigenetic alterations to empower a branch of the VHL-HIF pathway for metastasis, and the strength of this activation is associated with poor clinical outcome. more...

Early dissemination of tumor cells followed by an extended period of dormancy is thought to explain this prevalent clinical behavior. By using a gain-of-function retroviral cDNA screen in the mouse, we found that Coco, a secreted antagonist of TGF-beta ligands, induces solitary mammary carcinoma cells that have extravasated in the lung stroma to exit from dormancy. more...

293. Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers Reveals Tumor Cell of Origin in Glioma
(Submitter supplied) Cancer results from molecular mutations occurring in specific cell types, thus determining the cell-of-origin is critical for effective cancer treatment. Inferring such information from terminal tumors can be misleading because malignant tumor cells tend to acquire aberrant properties. Animal models are widely used because one can initiate mutations in specific cell types. However, cell-of-mutation that harbors initial molecular changes may not directly transform, rather merely passes along mutations to its progeny cell lineage, which then serves as cell-of-origin and finally transforms into malignancy. more...

294. Genomic analysis identifies unique signatures predictive of brain, lung, and liver relapse
(Submitter supplied) The ability to predict metastatic potential is of clinical and biological importance. Numerous metastasis/relapse predictors exist for breast cancer patients; however, what is less well established is whether predicting metastasis to specific organs sites is feasible. In this study we sought to determine: 1) the degree to which gene signatures vary across tumors and their metastases, 2) if genomic intrinsic subtypes associate with particular organs of relapse, and 3) if other genomic signatures can predict spread to specific organs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Pituitary tumours are generally benign. However, many are invasive and some of these are aggressive with high proliferation and recurrence rates. Only metastatic tumours are considered malignant and are rare (0.2%). To identify molecular events associated with the aggressive and malignant phenotypes, we combined a comparative genomic hybridization and transcriptomic analysis of 13 prolactin (PRL) tumours classified as non-invasive (NI; n=5), invasive (I; n=2) or aggressive-invasive (AI; n=6). more...

(Submitter supplied) Pituitary tumors are generally considered as benign. However, many are invasive (45 to 55%) and some are described as aggressive with a high proliferation rate and short post-operative time to recurrence and 0.2% metastasize. The molecular events associated to the progression of the pituitary tumor toward an aggressive and malignant phenotype is still unresolved. To bring new hypothesis on signaling pathways associated to the tumor progression, we applied a wide genome analysis approach combining transcriptome analysis and CGH analysis on the same 13 prolactin tumours classified as non-invasive (n=5), invasive (n=2) and agressive-invasive tumors (n=6). more...

304. Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs in BM+ vs. BM- lung cancer samples
(Submitter supplied) Brain metastasis (BM) can affect up to 25% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients during their lifetime. Efforts to characterize patients that will develop BM have been fairly disappointing. Small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of target mRNAs by repressing their translation or regulating their sequence-specific degradation.  miRNAs play a role in regulating a variety of targets and, consequently, multiple pathways, which makes them a powerful tool to be exploited for early detection of disease, risk assessment, and prognosis. more...

Subsequently, we observed that ectopic GLI1 promoted hormone independence in LNCaP cells (LNCaP-GLI1). We compared the gene expression profile of LNCaP-pBP (empty vector), LNCaP-GLI1, DU145, and PC-3 cells globally as well as to identify GLI1-regulated genes that may contribute to hormone independence.

Nonetheless, they lack to provide clues on a neglected layer of systems-level changes, the translatome, whose variations are defined by the activity of the translational regulatory machinery.   Our study extends the conventional genome-wide approaches to translatome profiling in neuroblastoma, by means of polysomal sucrose gradient separation followed by microarray analysis. more...
