1. Host-virus chimeric events in SARS-CoV2 infected cells are infrequent and artifactual
(Submitter supplied) Pathogenic mechanisms underlying severe SARS-CoV2 infection remain largely unelucidated. High-throughput sequencing technologies that capture genome and transcriptome information are key approaches to gain detailed mechanistic insights from infected cells. These techniques readily detect both pathogen and host-derived sequences, providing a means of studying host-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have reported the presence of host-virus chimeric (HVC) RNA in RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and interpreted these findings as evidence of viral integration in the human genome as a pathogenic mechanism. more...

39. Epithelial response to IFN-γ promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Submitter supplied) SARS-CoV-2, the agent causing COVID-19, invades epithelial cells, including those of the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa, using angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor. Subsequent inflammation can promote rapid virus clearance. However, severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by an inefficient immune response that fails to clear infection.  Using primary epithelial organoids from the colon, we explored how IFN-γ, a central antiviral mediator elevated in COVID-19, affects differentiation, ACE2 expression, and infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. more...

99. A Regulatory T Cell Notch4 Switch Governs Lung Inflammation in Viral Infections
(Submitter supplied) Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with lung inflammation and respiratory failure. In a prospective multi-country cohort of Covid19 patients, we found that increased Notch4 expression on circulating Treg cells was associated with increased disease severity, predicted mortality, and declined upon recovery. Deletion of Notch4 in Treg cells or therapy with anti-Notch4 antibodies in conventional and humanized mice suppressed the dysregulated innate immune response and rescued disease morbidity and mortality induced by a synthetic analogue of viral RNA or by the influenza H1N1 virus in an amphiregulin-dependent manner. more...

160. Blocking of the CD80/86 axis as a therapeutic approach to prevent progression to more severe forms of COVID-19
(Submitter supplied) In its more severe forms, COVID-19 progresses towards an excessive immune response, leading to the systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines like IL6, mostly from the infected lungs. This cytokine storm can cause multiple organ damage and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to identify therapies to treat and prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based on previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell co-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy against progression to severe proinflammatory states. more...

Using a modified cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) protocol we mapped sites of SL trans-splicing genome-wide in the marine chordate Oikopleura dioica and find evidence for proposed functions of SL-trans-splicing. A recent hypothesis postulates that operons facilitate recovery from growth arrested states in metazoans. more...

232. Viral Microarray - Cultured Virus Set
(Submitter supplied) Background: The analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data in pathogen surveillance and discovery assays is a challenging task. Target template concentration, nucleic acid integrity, and host nucleic acid composition can each have a profound effect on signal distribution. Exploratory analysis of fluorescent signal distribution in clinical samples has revealed deviations from normality, suggesting that distribution-free approaches should be applied. more...

233. Dynamic Innate Immune Responses of Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells against SARS-CoV and DOHV infection
(Submitter supplied) Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection causes an immune-mediated disease. We have recently shown that SARS-CoV-induced epithelial Calu-3 cytokines could exacerbate and dampen host inflammatory and T cell responses, respectively, through modulating the functions of macrophages and dendritic cells, thereby suggesting that not only are lung epithelial cells the primary cells of SARS-CoV infection,  but they also involve in initiating and orchestrating the host innate and adaptive immunity. more...

234. Gene expression profiling of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
(Submitter supplied) We used cDNA microarrays to systematically analyze host responses in SARS-infected individuals from onset of symptoms to discharge from hospital or death.  We modeled gene expression in 60 datasets from 40 unique patients of varied clinical evolution with emphasis on correlating innate and adaptive immune responses with discrete clinical phases of the disease. Keywords: Comparative patient class comparision, SARS patients relative to healthy controls
