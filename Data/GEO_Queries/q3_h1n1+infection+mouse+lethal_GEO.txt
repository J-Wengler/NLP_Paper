1. Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and Bcl6-/- helper T cell Transcriptomes
(Submitter supplied) Virus infection induces T follicular helper (TFH) and T helper 1 (TH1) cells. Although TFH cells are important in anti-viral humoral immunity, the role of TH 1 cells is still elusive. IgG2 antibodies predominate in the response to vaccination with inactivated Influenza A virus (IAV) and were responsible for protective immunity to lethal challenge with pathogenic H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 IAVs even in mice lacking TFH cells owing to B or T cell-specific ablation of the Bcl6. more...

2. Transcriptomics of murine ex vivo isolated alveolar type 2 epithelial cells from Influenza A respiratory infection
(Submitter supplied) Background: Influenza A virus (IAV) infections periodically cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the human population. In the lung, the primary targets for IAV replication are type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII), which are increasingly recognized for their immunological potential. However, our knowledge of the role of AECII in anti-IAV immunity is incomplete and their in vivo response to infection has not been evaluated. more...

3. Angiopoietin-like 4 Increases Pulmonary Vascular Leakiness and Lung Tissue Damage during Influenza Pneumonia
(Submitter supplied) cANGPTL4 has been shown by our experiments to be associated to influenza-induced pneumonia pathogenesis. cANGPTL4 was produced in abundance during infection and inflammation and showed involvment in regulating blood vessel permeability. By using anti-cANGPTL4 monoclonal antibody, we want to see the overall effect of this antibody treatment, to evaluate the potential of anti-cANGPTL4 antibody as a possible treatment method for pneumonia, and also to gain more insight into the role of cANGPTL4 in infection and inflammation. more...

4. Adjuvant induced attenuation of excessive inflammation in mice infected with pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus
(Submitter supplied) The reassorted human 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus infected millions of people and caused thousands of deaths with associated immunopathology.  Traditional immunosuppressants have limited capabilities in controlling inflammatory responses associated with severe influenza infections.  A new therapeutic strategy, therefore, must be developed.  We evaluated several adjuvants including toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, TLR independent adjuvants and Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) for limiting severe H1N1pdm infection outcomes in a mouse model. more...

5. Systems Analysis of a RIG-I Agonist Inducing Broad Spectrum Inhibition of Virus Infectivity [Kinetic]
(Submitter supplied) The RIG-I like receptor pathway is stimulated during RNA virus infection by interaction between cytosolic RIG-I and viral RNA structures that contain short hairpin dsRNA and 5’ triphosphate (5’ppp) terminal structure. In the present study, an RNA agonist of RIG-I was synthesized in vitro and shown to stimulate RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses at concentrations in the picomolar range. In human lung epithelial A549 cells, 5’pppRNA specifically stimulated multiple parameters of the innate antiviral response, including IRF3, IRF7 and STAT1 activation, andinduction of inflammatory and interferon stimulated genes - hallmarks of a fully functional antiviral response. more...

7. Lethal dissemination of H5N1 influenza virus is associated with dysregulation of inflammation and lipoxin signaling in a mouse model of infection
(Submitter supplied) Periodic outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses and the current H1N1 pandemic highlight the need for a more detailed understanding of influenza virus pathogenesis. To investigate the host transcriptional response induced by pathogenic influenza viruses, we used a functional-genomics approach to compare gene expression profiles in lungs from wild-type 129S6/SvEv and interferon receptor (IFNR) knockout mice infected with either the fully reconstructed H1N1 1918 pandemic virus (1918) or the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus Vietnam/1203/04 (VN/1203).

(Submitter supplied) Influenza A(H1N1)pdm virus caused the first human pandemic of the 21st century. Although various probiotic Lactobacillus species have been shown to have anti-microbial effects against pneumonia-inducing pathogens, the prophylactic efficacy and mechanisms behind their protection remain largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the prophylactic efficacy of heat-killed Lactobacillus pentosus b240 against lethal influenza A(H1N1)pdm virus infection in a mouse model. more...

13. IM002, IM009 - Implication of inflammatory macrophages, nuclear receptors and interferon regulatory factors in increased virulence of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus after host adaptation
(Submitter supplied) While pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A viruses were responsible for numerous severe infections in humans, these viruses do not typically cause corresponding severe disease in mammalian models. However, the generation of a virulent 2009 H1N1 virus following serial lung passage in mice has allowed for the modeling of human lung pathology in this species. Genetic determinants of mouse-adapted 2009 H1N1 viral pathogenicity have been identified, but the molecular and signaling characteristics of the host response following infection with this adapted virus have not been described. more...
