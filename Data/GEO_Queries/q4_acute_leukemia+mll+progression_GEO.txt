1. Gene expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs in myelodysplastic syndromes
(Submitter supplied) Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) present a wide range of hematopoietic stem cell disorders with a tendency to evolve into acute leukemia. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play multiple roles in hematopoiesis, contributing to the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies and representing a new class of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We aimed to characterize lncRNAs deregulated in MDS that may function in the disease pathogenesis and those that could serve as novel potential biomarkers of the disease. more...

2. DNA replication-timing boundaries separate stable chromosome domains with cell-type-specific functions
(Submitter supplied) Eukaryotic chromosomes replicate in a temporal order known as the replication-timing program. In mammals, replication timing is cell type-specific with at least half the genome switching replication timing during development, primarily in units of 400-800 kilobases ('replication domains;), whose positions are preserved in different cell types, conserved between species, and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome rearrangements. more...

3. DNA Damage Response and Inflammatory Signaling Limit the MLL-ENL-induced Leukemogenesis in vivo
(Submitter supplied) Activation of the MLL-ENL-ERtm oncogene initiates aberrant proliferation of myeloid progenitors. Here, we show induction of a fail-safe mechanism mediated by the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery that results in activation of the ATR/ATM-Chk1/Chk2-p53/p21 checkpoint and cellular senescence at early stages of cellular transformation caused by a regulatable MLL-ENL-ERtm in mice. Furthermore, we identified the transcription program underlying this intrinsic anti-cancer barrier, and DDR-induced inflammatory regulators that fine-tune the signaling towards senescence, thereby modulating the fate of MLL-ENL-immortalized cells in a tissue-environment-dependent manner. more...

4. Affymetrix SNP array data for acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples
(Submitter supplied) BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukaemia is characterized by the deletion of Ikaros. The Philadelphia chromosome, encoding BCR-ABL1, is the defining lesion of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed genome-wide analysis of leukemic samples from 23 CML cases and 304 ALL cases, including 43 BCR-ABL1 B-ALL cases. more...
