1. Suppression of MBD2 alternative splicing promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating FZD1 under hypoxia
(Submitter supplied) Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer (BrCa) deaths; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we report that suppression of MBD2 alternative splicing under hypoxia, which favors the production of MBD2a, facilitates BrCa metastasis. Specifically, we found that MBD2a promotes, whereas its less-known short form MBD2c suppresses metastasis. We elucidate that HIF-1 activation under hypoxia facilitates MBD2a production via repression of SRSF2-mediated alternative splicing and, as a result, the elevated MBD2a outcompetes MBD2c for binding to the promoter CpG islands to activate the expression of FZD1, thereby promoting EMT and metastasis. more...

2. Effect of bone marrow microenvironment on the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to antiestrogens
(Submitter supplied) Hormonal therapy (HT) inhibits the growth of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast (BrCa) and prostate (PrCa) cancers. HT resistance frequently develops within the complex metastatic microenvironment of the host-organ (often the bone), a setting poorly recapitulated in two-dimensional (2D) culture systems. To address this limitation, we cultured HR+ BrCa/PrCa spheroids and patient-derived organoids in 3D extracellular matrices (ECM) alone or together with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). more...

(Submitter supplied) Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most serious of all gynecological cancers, mainly due to its asymptomatic nature and the resulting lack of early diagnosis. Cells with defects in DNA repair accumulate genetic abnormalities and may progress to become malignant. However, this DNA repair deficiency makes tumor cells vulnerable to further compromise by therapeutic targeting of other associated pathways, using agents such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPIs). more...

34. The genome-wide enhancer profiling of breast cancer in the MMTV-PyVT mice [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Activation of transcription enhancers, especially super enhancers, is one of the important epigenetic features of tumorigenesis. However, only very few studies reported how the enhancer landscape evolves during tumorigensis. Here we utilized a proteomics approach and found that H3K27ac and H4K8ac are elevated in the mammary tumor of MMTV-PyVT mouse model, which was then confirmed by IHC results in human BRCA chips. more...

37. Genome-wide co-localization of RNA-DNA interactions and fusion RNA pairs (RNAseq)
(Submitter supplied) Despite the ever-increasing speed of detecting fusion transcripts in cancer, it remains formidable to predict what unreported RNA pairs can form new fusion transcripts. By systematic mapping of chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) and their respective genomic interaction loci, we obtained genome-wide RNA-DNA interaction maps from two non-cancerous cell types. The gene pairs involved in RNA-DNA interactions in these normal cells exhibited strong overlap with those with cancer-derived fusion transcripts. more...

39. Immunotherapy Utilizing NK cells and ADCC Mediating Agents with Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) Inhibition
(Submitter supplied) Background: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) prevent single-stranded DNA repair. Olaparib is a PARPi approved for the treatment of BRCA mutant ovarian and breast carcinoma. Emerging clinical data suggest a benefit of combining olaparib with immunotherapy in prostate cancer patients both with and without somatic BRCA mutations.   Methods: We examined if olaparib, when combined with IgG1 antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cetuximab (anti-EGFR), or avelumab (anti-PD-L1), would increase tumor cell sensitivity to killing by natural killer (NK) cells independently of BRCA status or mAb target upregulation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (mtBRCA1 and mtBRCA2) dramatically increase risk for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most commonly diagnosed histotype.  Other risk factors for this cancer, which originates primarily in the distal fallopian tube epithelium (FTE), implicate ovulation.  To test whether mtBRCA1 or mtBRCA2 FTE cells respond differently to peri-ovulatory follicular fluid (FF) exposure than control patient FTE, gene expression profiles from primary FTE cultures were compared at baseline, 24h after FF exposure, and 24h after FF replacement with culture medium. more...

46. Germline BRCA2 mutations drive prostate cancers with distinct evolutionary trajectories
(Submitter supplied) Germline mutations in the BRCA2 tumour suppressor are associated with both an increased lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa) and increased risk of aggressive disease. To understand this aggression, here we profile the genomes and methylomes of localized PCa from 14 carriers of deleterious germline BRCA2 mutations (BRCA2-mutant PCa). We show that BRCA2-mutant PCa harbour increased genomic instability and a mutational profile that more closely resembles metastastic than localized disease. more...

49. Level of FACT defines the transcriptional landscape and aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) FACT inhibition, via small molecule or shRNA, lead to reduced growth and viability of all BrCa cells tested. Phenotypic changes were more severe in high FACT cells (death or growth arrest) than in low FACT cells (decreased proliferation). Though inhibition had no effect on the rate of general transcription, expression of individual genes was changed in a cell-specific manner. Initially distinct transcriptional profiles of BrCa cells became almost identical via equalizing FACT expression. more...

However, the specific genes recurrently mutated as a consequence of BRCA1 dysfunction have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we utilized gene expression profiling to molecularly subtype 577 breast tumors, including 73 breast tumors from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Focusing on the RB1 locus, we analyzed 33 BRCA1-mutated, 36 BRCA2-mutated and 48 non-BRCA1/2-mutated breast tumors using a custom-designed high-density oligomicroarray covering the RB1 gene. more...

104. Integrated SV40 T/t-antigen Cancer Signature in Aggressive Breast, Prostate and Lung Carcinomas with Poor Prognosis
(Submitter supplied) Understanding the genetic architecture of cancer pathways that distinguishes subsets of human cancer is critical to developing new therapies that better target tumors based upon their molecular expression profiles.   In this study, we identify an integrated gene signature from multiple transgenic models of epithelial cancers intrinsic to the functions of the Simean virus 40 T/t-antigens that is associated with the biologic behavior and prognosis for several human epithelial tumors. more...
