1. Nicotinamide for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
(Submitter supplied) Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a highly prevalent and intractable form of cardiac decompensation commonly associated with diastolic dysfunction. Here, we show that diastolic dysfunction in patients with HFpEF is associated with a cardiac deficit in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Elevating NAD+ by oral supplementation of its precursor, nicotinamide, improved diastolic dysfunction induced by aging (in 2-year-old C57BL/6J mice), hypertension (in Dahl salt-sensitive rats) or cardiometabolic syndrome (in ZSF1 obese rats). more...

34. Three TF Gene Co-expression Modules are involved in Pressure-Overload Cardiac Hypertrophy in Male Mice (microRNA)
(Submitter supplied) Pathological cardiac hypertrophy, a dynamic remodeling process, is a major risk factor for heart failure. Although a number of key regulators and related genes have been identified, how the transcription factors (TFs) dynamically regulate the associated genes and control the morphological and electrophysiological changes during the hypertrophic process are still largely unknown. In this study, we obtained the time-course transcriptomes at five time points in four weeks from male murine hearts subjected to transverse aorta banding surgery. more...

37. The TGF-b superfamily cytokine GDF15 is a CCN2-regulated autocrine/paracrine factor in the heart
(Submitter supplied) Growth differentiating factor (GDF)15 is a TGFβ superfamily cytokine and a reported biomarker of heart failure. Myocardial expression of GDF15 is increased in heart failure. Yet, the mechanisms that control synthesis and release of GDF15 as well as the autocrine/paracrine functions of GDF15 on fibroblast function is lacking. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate signaling pathways and functions of GDF15  in cardiac fibroblasts. more...

(Submitter supplied) Left heart disease (LHD) frequently causes lung vascular remodelling and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Yet, pharmacological treatment for PH in LHD is lacking and its pathophysiological basis remains obscure. We aimed to identify candidate mechanisms of PH in LHD and to test their relevance and therapeutic potential. In rats, LHD was induced by supracoronary aortic banding. Whole genome microarray analyses were performed, candidate genes were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blots and functional relevance was tested in vivo by genetic and pharmacological strategies. more...

45. Pitx2 promotes heart repair by transcriptionally activating the antioxidant response after cardiac injury
(Submitter supplied) Myocardial infarction results in compromised myocardial function with heart failure due to insufficient cardiomyocyte self-renewal. Unlike lower vertebrates, mammalian hearts only have a transient neonatal renewal capacity. Reactivating the primitive reparative ability in the fully mature heart requires an intimate knowledge of the molecular mechanisms promoting early heart repair. Here we identified a novel factor that can sufficiently promote heart muscle repair. more...

(Submitter supplied) Altered myocardial gene expression from heart failure (HF) has mostly been identified by single-point analysis of end-stage disease.  This may miss earlier changes in gene expression that are transient and/or directionally opposite to those observed later. By sampling left ventricular myocardial tissue at different time points in a mouse model of cardiomyopathy, we examined differentially expressed transcripts between non-failing controls, early-HF (2 and 3 days after cardiac insult), peak-HF (10 days) and after recovery from HF (28 days). more...

62. Comparative Effects of Statins on Murine Cardiac Gene Expression Profiles in Normal Mice
(Submitter supplied) Recent clinical data suggest that the efficacy of statin treatment in patients with heart failure varies depending on the drugs administered. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to compare murine cardiac gene expression following treatment with four different statins. Statins directly regulated cardiac gene expression in a drug-specific manner in mice. The influence of each statin on the cardiac mRNA expression of various genes, including several genes that might be involved in the development of cardiac disease, was not a general effect of this class of drugs.

Exaggerated GRK2 activity plays a major pathophysiological role in the development of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and hypertension. GRK2 exerts its functions by kinase-dependent and kinase-independent effects. To assess the differential impact of GRK2 on cellular signalling we established HEK cell clones with over-expression of comparable protein levels of GRK2 or the kinase-deficient GRK2-K220R mutant, respectively. more...

70. Transgenic mice carrying the human PLN gene
(Submitter supplied) These mice have been genetically modified so that the mouse PLN gene has been replace with the human PLN gene. Phopspholamban (PLN), the reversible inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a), is a key regulator of myocyte Ca2+-cycling with a significant role in heart failure. We previously showed that the single amino acid difference between human and mouse PLN results in increased inhibition of Ca2+-cycling, cardiac remodeling and attenuated stress responses, in transgenic mice expressing the human PLN in the null background (hPLN). more...

105. Gata4 is required for postnatal cardiac function and protection from pressure overload-induced heart failure
(Submitter supplied) An important event in the pathogenesis of heart failure is the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In cultured cardiac cardiomyocytes, the transcription factor Gata4 is required for agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We hypothesized that in the intact organism Gata4 is an important regulator of postnatal heart function and of the hypertrophic response of the heart to pathological stress. more...

106. Distinct Gene Expression Profiles in Adult Mouse Heart Following Targeted  MAP Kinase Activation
(Submitter supplied) Three major MAP kinase signaling cascades, ERK, p38 and JNK, play significant roles in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in response to external stress and neural/hormonal stimuli.  In order to study the specific function of each MAP kinase branch in adult heart, we have generated three transgenic mouse models with cardiac specific and temporally regulated expression of activated mutants of Ras, MKK3 and MKK7, which are selective upstream activators for ERK, p38 and JNK, respectively. more...

107. heart/muscle-specific MnSOD-deficient mouse
(Submitter supplied) To investigate the pathological significance of excess oxidative stress in the heart, we generated heart/muscle-specific manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) -deficient mice on a C57BL/6 background using the Cre-loxP system uder the control of the muscle reatin kinase (MCK) promoter. The mutant mice developed progressive congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy and physical disability and died with a median survival rate of 15.4 ± 4.0 weeks. more...
