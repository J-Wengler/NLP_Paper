## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Natural language processing is a powerful computational technique that allows computers to understand human readable text 
and perform analysis with it. However no methods exist to help researchers harness this technique to gather related 
datasets. In this paper, we compare various techniques to help better understand which methods are viable for use 
to address this problem. We compare SpaCy and FastText as well as a variety of keyword extraction techniques in the PKE
Python package.
