## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Natural Language Processing is computational technique that allows computers to process human language [@doi:10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000464].
In the past, Natural Language Processing has been used in several biomedical applications such as concept extraction, electronic health record
analysis, and text mining. [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz682; @doi:10.1186/s12911-020-01352-2; @doi:10.1007/s40264-018-0762-z]. However there is a lack of research detailing natural language approaches to data collection, specifically the collection of relevant datasets for analysis. A variety of natural language processing models are effective on biomedical literature and several studies have shown their efficacy. In Chiu et al. basic principles of using natural language processing models with biomedical literature are investigated [[@https://aclanthology.org/W16-2922/]. The researchers found that a larger corpus is not necessarily a better corpus and that while the CBOW and Skip-Gram models can be accurately used, CBOW tends to perform better. In Wang et al. several comparisions between training sources for biomedical natural language tasks are studied. The researchers found that there was no singular model best suited for all biomedical natural language processing applications [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2018.09.008]. Recently an article was published that details an approach to dataset recommendation using a researchers interests and CV to identify datasets [@doi:10.1093/database/baaa064].
This paper also detailed some difficulties in dataset recommendation. Some of these challenges are a lack of widely-accepted metadata format, lack of available tools, and an exponential rise in available datasets [@doi:10.1093/database/baaa064]. 
In this paper we detail an alternative approach to address this problem using readily available natural language processing tools to identify related datasets from an initial set of related articles. 

The major obstacle to data collection for a researcher is a lack of available tools. The aforementioned paper details an approach to help address
this issue, but is not capable of using a user-generated query to identify related datasets. Another related tool is BioCaddie [@doi:10.1038/ng.3864] which is an ongoing tool to index current datasets to
make them easily searchable. However the advantage to our approach is that it requires no indexing and can be applied to any text-based data.
Our methodology utilises two techniques widely used in natural language processing, namely keyword extraction and word vector generation [@url:https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C16-2015; @doi:10.1038/s41597-019-0055-0].
Using these two tools, our approach can take several pre-identified datasets and identify other related datasets, no matter how niche the subject area. We test
a variety of these different techniques to identify those that are most promising for future use.
